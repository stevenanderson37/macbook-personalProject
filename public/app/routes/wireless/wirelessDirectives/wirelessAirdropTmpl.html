    <p>AirDrop makes sharing files with another Mac or an iOS device simple. With just a few clicks, you can take a file from any folder and use AirDrop to send it directly to a nearby Mac or iOS device. No need to email it or use any other web‑based service. It’s the simplest way to share a great photo on your Mac to your friend’s iPhone. Or send your contact info to a new colleague across the table.</p>
