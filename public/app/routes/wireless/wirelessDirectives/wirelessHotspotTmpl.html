    <p>If you’re out of Wi-Fi range, your MacBook can connect to the Personal Hotspot on your iPhone by using its cellular connection when it’s close by. So even when you’re far away from a Wi-Fi connection, using your MacBook to browse the web and send email is still well within reach. With the Instant Hotspot feature, you’ll see the name of your iPhone in the list of Wi‑Fi networks on your MacBook. Just select it and you’re connected. And when you’re not using your phone’s network, your devices intelligently disconnect to save battery life.<sup>6</sup></p>
