    <p>MacBook is not just ready for the wireless world. It was designed for it. Thanks to the latest wireless technologies — and innovative Apple software and services that let you get the most out of them — you can do nearly everything you need without plugging in. This portability allowed for an incredibly light and compact design that gives you enough room for a battery that lasts all day (up to 10 hours).<sup>1</sup> So MacBook is designed to go anywhere you want to go. And do everything you want to do along the way.</p>
