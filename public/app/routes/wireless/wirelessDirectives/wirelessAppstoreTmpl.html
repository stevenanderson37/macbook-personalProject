        <p>MacBook comes loaded with great apps for the things you do every day. And with thousands more apps to choose from, the Mac App Store opens up just as many possibilities for what your Mac can do. No need to plug in, connect, or install anything from a disc. Just one click and you can instantly download and install a new productivity tool or a killer game directly via Wi-Fi. The Mac App Store keeps track of your apps and tells you when an update is available. And you can even have your apps and macOS update automatically whenever you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network, so you’ll always have the latest version of every app you own.</p>
