  <p>Managing all your photos, music, and files used to mean syncing to multiple devices, transferring photos with cables, and emailing documents back and forth to yourself. iCloud simplifies your digital life by bringing all of these important pieces of information into a single account accessible from any Mac or iOS device. With iCloud Drive, you can safely store presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and any other kind of document or file and access them from anywhere. When youâ€™re signed in to your iCloud account on multiple devices, you can even use Handoff to pass a document seamlessly between them, picking up right where you left off. It all happens automatically, securely, and wirelessly.<sup>2</sup></p>
