    <h2>Quietly astonishing.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>MacBook has been engineered from the ground up for silent, efficient performance. It includes sixth-generation Intel Core M processors that run on just 5 watts of power, made even more efficient by optimizations throughout macOS. Together the processor and macOS sip so little energy that the system generates very little heat, so no fan is required to cool the computer. That means when your MacBook is working, you wonâ€™t hear a thing. And the logic board on which the processor sits has been painstakingly engineered to pack all the capability you expect in a Mac into as little space as possible.</p>
