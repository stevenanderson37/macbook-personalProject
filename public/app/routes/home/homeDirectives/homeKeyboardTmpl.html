    <h2>A full-size keyboard. <br> In a fraction of the space.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>We believe that a comfortable, full-size keyboard is essential for a great notebook <br> experience. But to fit one into the elegantly thin MacBook, we had to completely <br> rethink how a keyboard is engineered and constructed. We redesigned each key and its <br> underlying mechanism — not only making the whole keyboard much thinner, but also <br> allowing for more comfortable, precise, and responsive typing that just feels right.</p>

    <h2>The trackpad, pushed even further <br> with Force Touch.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>MacBook comes with a different way to experience a trackpad. The Force Touch trackpad is <br> engineered to deliver a responsive, uniform click no matter where you press the surface. And <br> underneath, force sensors detect how much pressure you’re applying. You can now use a Force click <br> to enable useful capabilities, like quickly looking up the definition of a word or previewing a file just <br> by clicking and continuing to press the trackpad. You’ll also experience haptic feedback — a tactile <br> vibration from the trackpad that adds the sense of touch to what you see on the screen. These <br> advanced capabilities work in addition to all the intuitive Multi-Touch gestures Mac users love. You’ll <br> be more in touch with your Mac than ever before. Without lifting a finger.</p>
