    <p>Our goal with MacBook was to do the impossible: engineer a full‑size experience into the lightest and most compact Mac notebook ever. That meant reimagining every element to make it not only lighter and thinner but also better. The result is more than just a new notebook. It’s the future of the notebook. And now, with sixth‑generation Intel processors, improved graphics performance, faster flash storage, and up to 10 hours of battery life,* MacBook is even more capable.</p>

      <h2>A Retina display that takes <br> everything to the edge.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>The moment you open your MacBook, its gorgeous 12-inch Retina display with edge-to- <br> edge glass brings everything into focus. Every photo leaps off the screen in rich, vibrant <br> detail. Over 3 million pixels render each letter with crystal clarity. And it all comes to light <br> on the thinnest Retina display ever on a Mac, meticulously honed to deliver a bold visual <br> experience within an impossibly minimal design.</p>

      <h2>A full-size keyboard. <br> In a fraction of the space.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>We believe that a comfortable, full-size keyboard is essential for a great notebook <br> experience. But to fit one into the elegantly thin MacBook, we had to completely <br> rethink how a keyboard is engineered and constructed. We redesigned each key and its <br> underlying mechanism — not only making the whole keyboard much thinner, but also <br> allowing for more comfortable, precise, and responsive typing that just feels right.</p>

      <h2>The trackpad, pushed even further <br> with Force Touch.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>MacBook comes with a different way to experience a trackpad. The Force Touch trackpad is <br> engineered to deliver a responsive, uniform click no matter where you press the surface. And <br> underneath, force sensors detect how much pressure you’re applying. You can now use a Force click <br> to enable useful capabilities, like quickly looking up the definition of a word or previewing a file just <br> by clicking and continuing to press the trackpad. You’ll also experience haptic feedback — a tactile <br> vibration from the trackpad that adds the sense of touch to what you see on the screen. These <br> advanced capabilities work in addition to all the intuitive Multi-Touch gestures Mac users love. You’ll <br> be more in touch with your Mac than ever before. Without lifting a finger.</p>

      <br>
      <p>As long as we were including a port for charging your MacBook, we wanted to make sure it was the most advanced and versatile one available. The USB-C port puts just about everything you need in a port all in one place. This amazing port provides charging, speedy USB 3 data transfer, and video output in a reversible design that’s one-third the size of a USB 3 port, giving you the flexibility to easily connect your favorite devices.</p>

All of which goes to show that sometimes less really is more.</p>

      <h2>Quietly astonishing.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>MacBook has been engineered from the ground up for silent, efficient performance. It includes sixth-generation Intel Core M processors that run on just 5 watts of power, made even more efficient by optimizations throughout macOS. Together the processor and macOS sip so little energy that the system generates very little heat, so no fan is required to cool the computer. That means when your MacBook is working, you won’t hear a thing. And the logic board on which the processor sits has been painstakingly engineered to pack all the capability you expect in a Mac into as little space as possible.</p>

      <h2>All-day battery life. <br> Now even longer.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>With the slim MacBook enclosure, all-day battery life simply would not be achievable <br> using traditional rectangular batteries. So we developed our own battery technology <br> specifically designed to make use of every last millimeter of available space. The <br> result is a terraced, contoured battery design that not only fits perfectly inside the <br> incredibly slim MacBook, but also is unlike anything seen before in a notebook. And <br> now, thanks to more efficient processors and improved battery chemistry, battery life <br> has been extended by an hour.</p>
